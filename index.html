                <p class="box-p">JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
                    ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
                    It
                    has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                    functions.
